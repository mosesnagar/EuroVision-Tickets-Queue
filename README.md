# EuroVision-Tickets-Queue

##### **IDC, Spring 2019**

## Introduction:

In this assignment you will simulate the process of selling tickets for the Eurovision song contest.

The Eurovision is an international song competition held primarly among the European countries. Each participating country
submits a song  to be performed on live television and radio, then casts votes for the other countries' songs to determine
the winner. Thanks to Netta Barzilay, this year we are fortunate enought to host the contest in Israel.

 Along with all the celebrations, this raises the following challenge:
 There is limited amount of tickets to the event and many willing event-goers. How could the tickets be districuted?
 
 One approach, "first-come, first-serve", is to sell the tickets according to the time the costumers registered for buying 
 the tickets. However, as we know, in Israel, this is rarely the way queue behave. In practice, not all customers are equal
 and some have priority over others. It could be the case that a VIP person, which has a high priority, will be able to buy tickets, 
 even though he registered after many regular, low priority, customers.
